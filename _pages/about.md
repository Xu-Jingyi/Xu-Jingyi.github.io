I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD) pillar at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), and my advisors are Prof. [Kai Fong Ernest Chong](https://people.sutd.edu.sg/~ernest_chong/) and Prof. [Tony Q.S. Quek](https://people.sutd.edu.sg/~tonyquek/). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree from Fudan University in June 2018. My research interest includes computer vision, robust learning, federated learning, and machine reasoning.
